# ASP Work Styles
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appirio-tech/work-styles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/appirio-tech/work-styles)

## Development
The purpose of this repo is to share common styles, mixins, and variables.

## Releases
Since npm does not support semvers, we use branches name accordingly, e.g. 1.x.x and 2.x.x.  Simply merge or rebase into those branches for a release.
